Basic CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) Architecture Practice

- Designed to identify drawings of numbers (0-9), provided by the mnist dataset (see archive.zip)
   - 6,000 datapoints to train on
   - 10,000 datapoints to test on
- Used PyTorch, pandas, numpy, scikitlearn, and matplotlib
- Image classification, can also be scaled to larger and more complex sets of data
